      <h1 class="display-1 ">What is wave management?</h1>

        <p>Wave Management is one of the most beneficial subjects to learn in League of Legends thanks to it being required in every single lane. Everybody has heard of wave management, but not everybody knows how to use it the right way. There are so many guides out there, but they all lack information that is crucial to understanding the subject fully.</p>

      <h2>How minion spawn</h2>

        <p>Minions start to spawn on the map from both sides at 1:05 and continue spawning every 30 seconds after until the game has ended. In the early game, they take 32 seconds to reach the middle of the lane after spawning. Depending on where the current wave is in lane, they may take longer or less time to get to the middle of the lane. Because the middle lane is shorter in length, minions arriving will only take 22 seconds to reach the middle of the lane instead of the 32 seconds in the side lanes.</p>

        <img class="cointainer" src="/images/Minion-wave-spreadsheet.webp" alt="Minion-wave-spreadsheet">
         
        <p>In every standard wave, there are 6 minions and in every cannon wave there is 7. For terminology purposes and to make it easier to understand, let’s say that there is only 1 block of minions (up until 20 minutes.) The first and second wave consists of 3 melee minions and 3 caster minions which is considered a standard wave. On every third wave up until 20 minutes, there are 7 minions: 3 melee minions, 1 siege minion, and 3 caster minions. This block of minions contains 3 waves before resetting. For each block of minions on the rift, there is a replacement block that is even stronger than the previous one. Every 90 seconds, aka 1 block, the minions become stronger and increase in health, survivability and damage.</p>

        <p>Up until 20 minutes, each third minion wave will be a cannon wave which includes one siege (cannon) minion. The first siege minion will spawn in at 2:05, and get to lane at around 2:37 in the side lanes and 2:27 in the mid lane. After 20 minutes, one will spawn every 2 waves. Instead of there being a block which consists of 3 waves, every block after 20 minutes will consist of 2 waves (1 standard wave and 1 cannon wave). After 35 minutes, there will no longer be any blocks and instead, every minion wave will be a cannon wave.</p>
        
        <p>If you’ve taken down an enemy inhibitor, every 30 seconds for 5 minutes (the length of the inhibitors respawn timer). there will be a super minion that will spawn with the wave. Each super minion will only go down the lane with the missing inhibitor. If you’ve destroyed all three of the enemies inhibitors, 2 super minions will spawn on each minion wave. While you take down an inhibitor, no cannon minions will spawn in that lane until it’s resurrected. </p>
        
        <p>All waves outside of the standard waves have one additional minion added to them. This will aid you in taking down the enemies defenses and achieving victory. Did you know that The Baron also empowers minions and makes them faster as well as deal more damage? When you’ve killed the Baron, everybody who is alive on the slayer’s team receives the “Hand of Baron” buff.</p>
        
        <p>This buff gives your allies and your minions a plethora of bonuses which can allow your team to siege and take objectives with ease. One of the best buffs is the bonus movement speed that champions can give the minions when near them. This will speed them up and allow them to get into the action quicker.

      <h2>Minion pushing advantage</h2>

        <p>This section here isn’t necessarily super important to know the exact detail inside and out, but here’s a summary if you want to skip this part of the guide. Basically, if your team is ahead, your minions will be stronger than the enemies – it’s as simple as that.</p>

        <p>There are 3 types of bonuses that your minions get if you’re ahead. The bonuses they obtain revolve around having a larger average level on your team than the enemies, as well as having more turrets down in any specific lane.</p>

        <p>The way this is worked out is: the average level of your team, minus the average level of the enemy team. Which is always capped at 3.0.</p>

        <p>If your team has the level advantage, your minions will deal bonus damage to the enemy minions equal to 5% + 5% per turret advantage in a specific lane. This is then multiplied by your teams level advantage.</p>

        <p>For example, if you’re two towers ahead of the enemy- it would be: (5% + (5% x 2)) x team level advantage. = bonus damage. We cannot answer this mathematical question because A, I’m no good at maths and B, it’s a very situational answer that changes from game to game depending on in game factors which would make knowing the answer useless.But hey, that’s the bonus damage your minions will do to enemy minions.</p>

        <p>Your minions will also receive less damage from the enemy minions equal to 1 + 1 per turret advantage in lane.</p>

        <p>For example, if you’re two towers ahead of the enemy- it would be: 1 + (team level advantage x 2) = damage reduction.</p>

        <p>If the difference between average team levels is 3 or higher and the leading team has destroyed two or more towers than the enemy in a single lane, the minions on that team will become enraged which gives them even more bonuses. The minions bonus damage is increased by a further 90%, and the flat damage reduction is increased by 7 more points per auto attack.</p>

        <p>You do not really need to know what the exact numbers and bonuses your minions will receive because it is constantly changing and really hard to check- and not necessary. Just remember that if you’re ahead, the minions will receive reduced damage and deal extra damage.</p>

      <h2>Wave timing</h2>
        
        <p>Here’s a very basic rundown of when and where you should expect minions to be at any given time around major objectives. The reference timers are just as the first minion passes each objective. Please note that this is a reference and the numbers might be slightly out depending on in-game factors or user discrepancy.</p>

        <img class="cointainer" src="/images/Wave-tming-spreadsheet.png" alt="Wave timing">

      <h2>How is this information helpful</h2>

        <p>While knowing the exact timers is not going to be of much use to you, having an understanding of when and where the minions will be on the map at any given time can help you to improve your back timing. If you know when and where the minions will be, you can back at the right time to miss out on minimal farm and experience. This will allow you to stay even with the enemy and not fall behind. Backing at the wrong time or being killed and missing out on CS is devastating in a snowball heavy meta.</p>

        <p>Another way of knowing the location of the minion wave is looking at your own minion wave on the map. This is a favored method commonly used by players. As every lane is mirrored, you should expect all minions to get to certain areas of the map at the same time. If you see that your cannon wave is approaching, the enemies cannon wave will also be coming shortly.</p>

        <p>Unless you’re forced to back, you should try to never Recall on a cannon wave. A cannon minion gives more gold and experience than any other minion during the laning phase so you need to try and get it to avoid falling behind. If the enemy gets the cannon minion and you do not, they will gain the lead. If a cannon minion wave has already started making its way across the map and has left the base, you may miss out on it if you decide to back. Ideally, you should back before the cannon wave gets out of the base.</p>

        <p>It takes roughly 25 seconds in the mid lane and 30 seconds in the side lanes to get back in the action (without boots.) This means that in the early game, you should not be in the fountain when a minion wave is approaching the tier 2 towers (in the side lane) as you may miss out on them. In the later stages of the laning phase, you have a little bit more leniency.</p>

        <img class="large-image" src="/images/Movement-Travel-Times.jpg" alt="How long it takes">

        <p>You should try to back after shoving the wave into the enemies tower as quickly as you can. This will slow down the enemies minion wave allowing you to return to lane without missing much in terms of farm and experience. If you push the wave under the enemies tower, the wave will start pushing it back towards you and stopping either in the middle of the lane or closer to the enemies tower.</p>

        <p>If the wave resets, that’s good for you as it will stay in the middle of the lane and not push in either direction. However, if the minion wave is on the enemies side, then it will start pushing towards you- allowing for a big wave to form and it giving you a ton of CS as we can see in this video.</p>
