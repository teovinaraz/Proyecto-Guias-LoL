  <H1>Vision Control</H1>
        <p> <span>Vision control</span> is one of the most important aspect in every game. <span>Warding</span> in League of Legends is incredibly important for every role and every game you play. It is a necessity for everyone to know when to ward, where to ward and how to become better at warding.</p>
        <p>Without adequate vision control, you will find it difficult to survive the early game, win the mid game and close out the late game. When you understand the fundamentals of warding and how you can use it to your advantage it can really help you win more.</p>
    <h2>Laning phase warding</h2>
        <p>At level 1, there are a variety of different warding strategies and tactics that you can prepare but not all of them are always going to be worth warding. Before that, I want to discuss how you can save your first ward by positioning better before the minions start to spawn. As we all know, you should position in an area to scout the enemy in case they try to invade. Each role has a (sort of) designated spot where they should stand to spot the enemy.</p>
          <img src="/images/Laning-phase1.jpg" alt="Spots where to ward on laning phase">
        <p>If you stand in these areas like suggested, you will not have to place your ward at level 1, nor will you have to walk into the unknown when you make your way to your lane after leashing for your Jungler. Walking into the unknown can be very dangerous and you may have to blow your Flash early or you may have to recall even before getting to lane which can mess up your early game. While this is not always the case for the top or mid lane, it can very well be the norm for the bottom lane.</p>
        <p>Standing in an area like suggested will help you save your first ward as you will not need to use it early to spot the enemy as you would be using yourself as a ward. There are some exceptions to this rule, however, such as playing against a Blitzcrank or Thresh who can hook you level 1 or if the enemy is notorious for invading before minions spawn. When something like this occurs, you should stay in this position up until you spot them and then start running away. Before doing so, you should drop and place a ward so you can see if the enemy continues to chase you.</p>
    <h2>After laning phase warding</h2>
        <p>We’ve discussed the laning phase, where you could ward, and we’ve discussed a lot of vision information, but we haven’t really touched on what to do after the laning phase has ended. Continue to buy Control Wards in the early game, the mid game and the late game. Just because you buy a Control Ward in the early game and it’s still alive, it doesn’t mean that you should not buy another one and place it somewhere else. If your Control Ward is alive but the game has moved on, place another Control Ward in a different area.</p>
        <p>Here is a guide to where you could look to ward if the game is even and it’s practically a stalemate. A lot of the Control Wards suggested are just like the wards in laning phase and that is a pretty common sign you’ll see throughout this section.</p>
      <h3>Blue team warding spots in even conditions</h3>
          <img src="/images/Blue-team-general-control-wards-1.jpg" alt="Blue side spots for control warding">
        <p>Even wards are a great way of providing your team with information of the Jungler if they enter the river or if anybody has left their lane. River wards or even wards are vision that is placed evenly along the map. If you were to cut the map in half, they would be along the joining line. Warding here is great because it can tell you if the Jungler is entering your jungle, leaving your jungle or going to gank a lane. It can also tell you if somebody has left lane in order to roam, rotate or go to an objective.</p>
      <h3>Red team warding spots in even conditions</h3>
        <p>Just like the blue team, when you are playing as red team, you should prioritize having wards that are even on the map when a game is pretty close. Warding in these areas like suggested will give your team a lot of information and protect your team thanks to the location of many of them.</p>
          <img src="/images/Red-team-general-control-ward-even-1.jpg" alt="Blue side spots for control warding">
        <p>You will see a lot of similarities between the two pictures and you can technically use both if you are on either side of the map. So make sure to use both of the ‘even warding’ images to your advantage for future reference.</p>
        <p>Just like before, if the game is looking rough and you are losing across the board, it’s time to start bringing your Control Wards back into your own jungle to give you some security and protection.</p>
    <h2>Warding objectives</h2>
        <p>When it comes to taking a major objective such as the Elder Dragon, an elemental Dragon or The Baron, you will need to have enough vision around the objective to make it safer to take. As both teams are practically the same, we will discuss both the warding locations for both teams in one go. This will allow you to adapt to each situation and allow you to know where to ward when you’re on both sides of the rift.</p>
        <p>The further the wards are from the objective, the longer length of time you will have to react to the enemy. If you’re unable to finish the objective in time, you can back off and let it reset or if you can take it- try to burn it down and finish it off. If you are able to turn on the enemy and fight them, then you can also do that if you’re sure can win the team fight. In a lot of situations, fighting for a 50/50 Baron is not worth it so having good ward coverage can definitely help you out.</p>
      <h3>Warding objectives on blue side</h3>
          <img src="/images/Blue-team-objective-control-1.jpg" alt="Where to ward objectives on blue side">
        <p>It is recommended that you also place a mixture of wards that can be sacrificed to slow down the enemies advance. While it’s not ideal, making the enemy waste time is a good way of gaining a small advantage when it comes to finishing of the objective. I do not recommend that you use this as a general rule as it is a waste of wards, but it is something to keep in mind when you’re trying to rush and take an objective.</p>
      <h3>Warding objectives on red side</h3>
        <p>Depending on what side of the map you’re on, you always want to have dedicated vision in the enemy’s side of the map. These wards will tell you if enemy decide to contest the objective. For example, if you’re the red team, you would want to ward over and around the Dragon to spot the enemy. You would not want to ward your own jungle as the probability of the enemy coming from your jungle is near impossible. As the Dragon pit is on the blue side of the map, to spot the blue team, you need to ward the blue side of the map around the pit.</p>
          <img src="/images/Red-team-objective-control-1.jpg" alt="Where to ward objectives on red side">
        <p>Compared to the blue team, when you wanted to take the Dragon, you should ward the red side jungle. This is also true for the Baron. As the blue team, you would want to ward evenly and in the enemies jungle to make it safer to take the objective. Where as for the red team, you would want to ward evenly and ward the blue side top jungle.</p>
